## GDP Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data using various techniques and visualizations. GDP is a critical indicator of economic health, reflecting the total value of goods and services produced within a country over a specific period. Understanding GDP growth rates and comparisons between countries can provide insights into economic trends and performance.

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- plotly
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas plotly numpy
```

Additionally, to use Plotly for interactive visualization, you will need to set up an account at [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and install the Plotly library.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains GDP data for various countries over multiple years. Before conducting any analysis, it's essential to perform a dataset walkthrough to understand its contents, identify any issues, and get familiar with the data structure. You can use `df.head()` to get a brief overview of the dataset.

### GDP Growth Analysis

GDP growth analysis involves calculating the percentage change in GDP over time. This can provide insights into how an economy is expanding or contracting. The formula used to calculate GDP growth rate is:

```
GDP growth rate = (GDP in current period - GDP in previous period) / GDP in previous period * 100
```

By applying this formula, you can visualize the GDP growth rate over time for different countries.

### Plotting Graphs Using Plotly

Plotly is a powerful tool for creating interactive plots and charts in Python. It offers various functionalities for data visualization and exploration. In this repository, Plotly is utilized to visualize GDP data across different countries, compare GDP growth rates, and analyze trends.
